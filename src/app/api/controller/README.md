# Controller folder
- The controllers that serves as a bridge between the frontend and the backend.
- All API calls should be made through these controllers.
- Static vs Dynamic
    - This pattern is designed so the UI can be reusable
    - The static folder is not to be edited.
    - The dynamic folder should be edited to match the API used.
